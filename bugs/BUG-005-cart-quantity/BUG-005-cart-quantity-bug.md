Title:
Cannot update quantity of items in cart

Description:
Users cannot adjust the quantity of products in the cart. This prevents ordering multiple units of the same item without repeatedly clicking “Add to cart,” reducing usability and efficiency.

Environment:
- Browser: Chrome
- Saucedemo web app

Preconditions:
- User is on the Products page

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add one or more items to the cart
2. Navigate to the cart page
3. Attempt to change the quantity of an item
4. Observe that quantity cannot be edited

Expected Result:
- Quantity field should be editable, allowing users to increase or decrease the number of items in the cart

Actual Result:
- Quantity is not editable; users cannot adjust item amounts directly

Severity: Minor (functional limitation affecting usability, but not breaking core workflow)

Priority: Medium
